# Introduction

>SK Vidar´s training approach for distance runners is not a revolutionary concept but rather an evolutionary progression. It is rooted in a century of training history, drawing inspiration from various approaches developed over time. 

## Notable contributors
* Gerschler, who emphasized training within specific heart rate ranges
* Zatopek, known for his implementation of submaximal interval training
* Lydiard and Van Aaken, who stressed the importance of building a solid aerobic base through high-volume training at an easy pace.
* Bowerman, who demonstrated the benefits of alternating between hard and easy training days. Building on the [work that Marius Bakken](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/5/3782) did in the in the early 2000s.
* Marius Bakken explained on [his website](http://www.mariusbakken.com/the-norwegian-model.html) and in several podcast episodes of “I det lange løp” [episode1](https://radio.nrk.no/podkast/i_det_lange_loep/sesong/202110/l_c5440ab9-62ab-48b3-840a-b962ab28b3d6), [episode2](https://radio.nrk.no/podkast/i_det_lange_loep/sesong/202110/l_1e7c3ca9-d5ae-456b-bc3c-a9d5ae556b92) Bakken laid the groundwork for the Ingebrigtsen brothers and the Norwegian triatlon team coached by Olav Aleksander Bu. 

## SK Vidar
Most of SK Vidar´s current training principles are adaptations by Markus Harbo and Gustav Vasdal in order to make this training model fit for the biggest common denominator. Complete amateurs as well as competitive sub-elite runners can use this model to get faster and become better overall runners whilst staying injury free.
