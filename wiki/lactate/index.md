# Lactate
 
It is widely accepted that lactate metabolism serves as a useful index, although not likely as a cause of muscular fatigue and that a **strong** correlation exists between lactate accumulation and level of performance in endurance events.The relationship between running intensity/speed and blood lactate is widely used to predict and identify performance in distance runners.

The exact mechanisms explaining the relationship between training near or at the ventilatory lactate threshold (vLT2) and performance improvement, as well as its physiological effects, are not fully understood. However, it has been suggested that exercising at this intensity may enhance muscle-specific adaptations by improving lactate clearance rather than reducing lactate production.

It is likely that only the motor units recruited during training experience increases in mitochondrial number and capillary density. This means that training near vLT2 may optimize the recruitment of motor units without the potential drawbacks associated with higher levels of catecholamines that are typically experienced with intense zone 4 (z4) training. (mdpi)

::: tip To put it in practical terms:
We´re looking for what Bakken calls the “sweet spot training zone”, Training at lower intensities not only yields better results, one can also do significantly more training without wearing down , this translates for most people to somewhere between 1.5-3.0 mmol as opposed to closer to 4.0 mmol. (Bakken, 2021).

::: details For those who don't have a blood lactate meter available
Combining the use of heart-rate (typically under 85% of max. hr), talking capacity (typically one should still be able to say something like: “yes coach, I'm doing alright) and overall perceived feeling during and after exercise can also be used. Since lactate is as person specific as heart-rate, one needs to build up a personal database and analyse over time if the intensity and training load needs to be adjusted up or down. Experience teaches us it´s better to be on the safe side, for most people this is a level even closer to 2mmol than 3mmol.s
