## Lactate Threshold 

In order to manage overall training intensity as explained in lactate (link) one need to run below or at the lactate threshold (vLT2). In order to be as precise as possible we advise on measuring lactate. Other ways of intensity control can be used and/or in addition to this. The body is the best instrument we have at our disposal but it needs to be calibrated. Just like very few athletes can guess which speed they are running at, few can run at the desired intensity based on  perceived feeling and heart-rate alone, similarly we are looking for an inner intensity rather than and outer one, therefore speed will vary from day to day depending on overall training load, sleep, nutrition, training conditions and overall stress in life. One wants to be aiming to hit a certain mmol rather than a certain pace to optimize the training stimulus, and to make sure the athlete does not go over a certain tipping point.

External load provides useful information for tracking performance progress, internal load, measured through parameters like heart rate or blood lactate levels, is considered a more accurate indicator of effort for distance runners and other sports. Monitoring internal load and using that information to adjust training intensity allows for optimal stimulation and aligns with current training recommendations. (Casado et al)
